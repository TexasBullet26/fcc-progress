# Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables
---
Before we dive into Object Oriented Programming, let's revisit JavaScript objects.

Give your `motorBike` object a `wheels`, `engines` and `seats` attribute and set them to numbers.

Tests needed to meet:
  - `motorBike` should have a `engines` attribute set to a number.
  - `motorBike` should have a `wheels` attribute set to a number.
  - `motorBike` should have a `seats` attribute set to a number.
